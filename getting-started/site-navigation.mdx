## Navigation Methods

There are two main ways to navigate through the internal apps:

## Breadcrumb Navigation

You can use the navigation breadcrumbs below the navbar to navigate backwards through the site hierarchy:

![Navigation Breadcrumbs](/images/navigation-breadcrums.png)

The breadcrumbs show your current location and allow you to quickly return to previous pages or sections.

## Navigation Menu

You can also click the menu in the top right of the screen to quickly navigate to different apps:

![Navigation Menu](/images/navigation-menu.png)

The menu provides quick access to all available applications and sections of the site. You can also view your email, job title, department and registered office location.
