## Access

Anyone in the Marketing department has access to updating forms and collecting data.

## Admin Form Access

### Step 1: Navigate to Marketing Materials

Your <a href={`${site_url}/marketing-materials`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing materials page</a> will look slightly different. In the top right, you will have access to the admin form:

### Step 2: Manage Form Structure

Once you navigate to the admin form, you can:
- Create, edit, and delete questions
- Create or remove sections
