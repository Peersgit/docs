## Home Office Order Management

The process is slightly different for home office administrators:

## Creating Orders (All Home Office Staff)

If your department is not Marketing or Purchasing, your process is as follows:

1. Create a new order
2. Select a store location using the location picker
3. Follow the remaining steps outlined in the [Ordering Items](/dc-orders/user/ordering-items) guide

## Managing DC Items (Marketing & Purchasing Only)

If you are in the Purchasing or Marketing department, you have access to edit DC items. You can update the item list at:

<Card
  title="Access DC Items Home Office"
  icon="external-link"
  href={`${site_url}/store-supplies/dc-items-admin/`}
  target="_blank"
  horizontal
/>

### Viewing All Items

You can view all DC items in the system:

### Adding and Updating Items

You can add, view, and update item information:

![Item Management Edit Item](/images/item-management-edit-item.png)

### Validating Items in Dynamics

When creating a new item or updating an existing item, you must validate the item in Dynamics first:

![Create Pre-Validate](/images/create-pre-validate.png)

![Create Post-Validate](/images/create-post-validate.png)

On successful validation, you can save the DC item.
